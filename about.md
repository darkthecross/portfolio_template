Always curious about new technologies, and interested in reality-related interactions, including robotics, robot perception, intelligent devices etc.

~~Was once very athletic. Good at cooking. Play Dota2.~~

Graduated from Tsinghua University in 2015, then went to the University of Michigan (2016-2018).

Worked at Mechmind Robotics as a Robot Algorithm Engineer, but is now working for Google as a Software Engineer. Very open to make friends and build connections with geeks.
