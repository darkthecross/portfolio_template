# A template for UXE portfolio websites.

## Dependencies:
* [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)

## Development:

###Install jekyll first. 

I hope you have a basic understanding about how jekyll works: it feeds contents (html, md) into layouts, with some basic condition/loop operations. 
It generates a static site, which makes it perfect for serverless websites. It works with github pages. (And these are the reasons I decided to use it.)

### Understand the directory.

"_includes" defines some components for the templates. "_layouts" defines templates for the webpages. "_posts" contains the projects/blogs/passages...There're certain restrictions about the posts, like you should always assign a timestamp for each post, and they will be shown in chronical order... I personally don't like it.

### Adding a project/post is easy!

Just add a new file in "_posts" according to the other posts.

## Deployment:

Upload the whole repository to a git repo with the name yourusername.github.io. It is that easy.
