            This is a part of the course project for the <a href="https://autorob.github.io/" target="_blank">Autonomous Robots</a> course of the University of Michigan.

            The code for this project can not be made public, since they're still the homeworks for this course.

            The CCD inverse kinematics algorithm is fast, yet provides with jerky movements, thus it is generally used as the verification of reacheability for the robots without an analytical IK solution.
