            I interned at Mechmind robotics in Beijing in the summer at 2017, where I worked with the robotics algorithms working on real industrial robots.

            <p>
            As a robot algorithm engineer, my work included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Implemented the inverse kinematics algorithm for ABB-IRB4600 robot, a large one with over 60kg capacity.
                    The code is still working well on over 10k real robots!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Designed an algorithm to detect and avoid sigularity points during the motion planning of ABB-IRB1200 and ABB_IRB4600.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implemented the collision detection of robot motion planning using <a href="https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl" target="_blank"> fcl </a> and
                    integrated into the software product of the company.
                </li>
                <li>
                    implemented quaternion interpolation algorithm to enable smooth motion of the industrial robots.
                </li>
            </ul>
